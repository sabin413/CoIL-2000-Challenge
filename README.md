# Predicting Potential Customers For an Insurance Policy - CoIL 2000 Challenge
Sabin Adhikari

### The Problem
Proper identification of potential customers is a crucial step in any effective marketing process. Insurance companies invest a lot of time and resources to find their potential customers. The goal of this project is to identify the features which are important in deciding whether a customer has an insurance policy from a given provider or not, and build a model to identify possible customers. This problem is adopted from CoIL 2000 Challenge. More information about the CoIL 2000 challenge can be found here

### Who are the clients and why do they care about this?
Our client in this project is a life incurance comany. The company wants to reduce its marketing cost by avoiding sending mails to those people who are not likely to buy their policy. The analysis of this data will give important insights about the present policy holders. The machine learning model will help to quickly find out the customers who are more likely to buy the insurance policy. The company could do directed marketing to the possible customers predicted by the model which would significantly reduce the marketing cost. 

### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
The data set is available in UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+%28COIL+2000%29. 
It includes product usage data and socio-demographic data of policy holders derived from zip area codes. It consists of 86 variables and 9000 instances, and is only 1 MB in size. 

### Brief outline of the approach to solving this problem
1. I will perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and inferential statistics to understand the data. I intend to identify the important features and their correlations.
2. I will build multiple classification models and compare them to find the best predictive model.

### Deliverables

My deliverables will include a project writeup in the form of a report and the code which will be made available in my GitHub repository.
