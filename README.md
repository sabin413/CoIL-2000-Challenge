# Predicting Potential Customers For an Insurance Policy - CoIL 2000 Challenge

This data set has information on customers of an insurance company and is from CoIL 2000 Challenge.  The goal of this project is to identify the features which are important in deciding whether a customer has an insurance policy or not, and build a model to predict the potential customers. 

The data set includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. It consists of 86 variables and 9000 instances, and is only 1 MB in size. It is available in UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+%28COIL+2000%29. 

The analysis of this data gives important insights which are helpful to find the potential customers. The machine learning model helps to quickly find out the customers who are more likely to buy the insurance policy. Efficient identification of potential customers reduces the cost of marketing, for example, the company could do directed marketing to the customers predicted by the model.
